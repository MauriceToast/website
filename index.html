        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    
    <p class="effective-date">Effective as of 09/02/2025</p>

    <p>These terms and conditions of use (referred to as 'Terms') govern the legal framework for providing the Betpuck application and define the conditions of access and use of the services by 'the User'.</p>

    <p>These Terms are accessible on the application under the 'Terms' section.</p>

    <p>Any registration or use of the Betpuck application implies unconditional acceptance of these Terms by the user. When registering on the application, each user expressly accepts these Terms by checking the box preceding the following text: 'I have read and accept the terms and conditions of use'. In case of non-acceptance of the Terms stipulated in this contract, the User must refrain from accessing the services offered by the application.</p>

    <p>Betpuck reserves the right to unilaterally modify these Terms at any time.</p>

    <h2>Article 1: Legal Notices</h2>

    <p>The Betpuck application is published by the Individual Enterprise (EI) PORT Clément, registered with the National Register of Enterprises (RNE) under number 940 694 441, whose head office is located at 02 Rue André Ampère, 64000, Pau.</p>

    The Director of publication is: Clément PORT</p>

    <h2>ARTICLE 2: Application Content</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Nature of the service</h3>

    <p>The application provides a platform for organizing one or more prediction contests between friends, family, colleagues, or others on ice hockey competitions. Users can join private competitions, organized by an Administrator in which they play within a private network. After registration, the User can either create a competition (2.1.1) or join a competition (2.1.2). The application also contains updated information on the results and rankings of the presented competitions. The results and other statistical information displayed on the site are based on information provided by other independent sources (third parties), internal work, or other official applications. The User is solely responsible for the use of the results and other information displayed on the site and the trust the user places in this information.</p>

    <h4>2.1.1 Creating a competition</h4>
    <p>By creating a competition, the User obtains Administrator status, and then has the choice between:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating a prediction contest based on the complete calendar of an official competition;</li>
        <li>Creating a customized prediction contest (choice of competition, choice of calendar...).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once the competition is created, the Administrator has an invitation URL (address of a website or hypertext page on the internet) and a Token (sequence of characters assigned to a competition to allow Users to join it) which they will use to invite participants to the contest.</p>
    <p>Once the invitation is accepted and their account created, new Users can start playing.</p>

    <h4>2.1.2 Joining a competition</h4>
    <p>The User has the possibility to directly join a private competition organized by an Administrator, via an invitation URL or a Token</p>

    <h3>2.2 Access to the application</h3>

    <p>The Betpuck application is freely accessible anywhere to any User with Internet access. All costs incurred by the User to access the service (computer hardware, software, Internet connection, etc.) are at their expense.</p>
    <p>The Betpuck application is in principle accessible to Users at any time, but for proper management, the individual enterprise Clément PORT reserves the right to:</p>

        <li>Remove any information that may disrupt its operation or contradict French or European legislation;</li>
        <li>Suspend the use of the application for technical reasons.</li>
    </ul>
